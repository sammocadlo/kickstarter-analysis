# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	Data from mulitple Kickstarter campaigns was analyzed to assist Louise with planning a Kickstarter for their theater project. The data included Kickstarter campaigns from all over the globe spanning multiple  different goals and categories to allow for a thorough analysis.
	
## Analysis and Challenges
  The findings of this analysis are based around the launch date of theater Kickstarter campaigns, and the goals set for Kickerstarts for plays. Both of these are looking at campaigns from across the globe.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  Looking at the launch dates of various Kickstarter campaigns, as seen in the chart above, two conclusions can be drawn. The first, that campaigns that are started in the month of June see the most success. The second is that campaigns are far less likely to be successful if they are started between the months of September and March.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The campaign goals are the second indicator of whether a campaign could be successful. Based on the data in the graph above, Kickstarters with a goal less than $1000.00 up to $5000.00 have at least a 60% success rate. The success rate increases the smaller the goal is.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  Some possible challenges in working with this dataset could be the scope of the data, as then it must be decided how broad or narrow the analysis should be.
## Results

  This dataset is limited by it's scope. There are varying factors to success in a Kickstarter campaign, and parsing the data down to what may be helpful in planning a Kickstarter may lead to factors being overlooked.

  Other possible tables and graphs that could be drawn from this data would be a chart showing goals vs pledges and the relation to success rate. Another would be a table showing the statistics of the goals and pledges for play Kickstarters.
