# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis of Kickstarter data to discover trends regarding theater and play Kickstarter projects.

The first chart below demonstrates the success and failures of different Kickstarter campaigns across multiple catergories. The second chart shows the success and failures of only Theater campaigns based on the month of the year that the campaign began.

Based on the research findings, campaigns based around theater projects that are started in the month of June have higher success rates on average. Theater projects as a whole are also generally more successful than other types of campaigns, as shown in the Parent Category Outcomes chart. Analysis of the goal and pledge amounts of play campaigns from the US shows that failed campaigns started with higher goals on average, though the median pledged is also very low which could indicate that the amount of money being asked for was not the only issue. If the only issue was the goal being too high, the median pledged would be closer to the median pledge amount from successful campaigns.
